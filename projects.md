All project outlines are posted on Slate.

Projects are to be submitted on Slate by the end of class on the due date specified.

Rubrics, grades, and feedback are provided via Slate. 

If you have any questions/concerns about the projects or subsequent feedback, please get in touch.

Your PAL is available to help you with technical issues, such as code and design, but cannot give definitive answers about the assignment requirementsâ€”please direct those questions to Ryan.
