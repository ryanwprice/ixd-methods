## Communication

### Office Hours

Office hours will occur during class. We have 6 hours each week, which is more than enough time to discuss anything you may need help with.

### Email

Make sure that you check your Sheridan email (and Slate) account regularly, as I may send any course updates and information to this account. You can setup your account to forward to your personal email account, so you never miss any relevant information. You should also setup your Slate email to forward to your Sheridan email as well.

I can be reached at [ryan.price1@sheridancollege.ca](mailto:ryan.price1@sheridancollege.ca) and will reply within 24 hours except on the weekends. If you do not get a response within this time, please assume that your email was not delivered and send it again.

Emailing me the night before an assignment is due will not likely get the desired response time, so stay on top of work to ensure your questions do not go unanswered.

### Software & Hardware

We will be using [Repl.it](https://replit.com) to write HTML, CSS.

## Grading

All assignments are to be completed for the _end of class_ on the date assigned unless noted otherwise.

Assignments are posted online with detailed assignment outlines, due dates, grade weight, rubric, etc.. If you have any questions about the assignment, please get in touch before the due date. Your PAL is here to help you with technical issues, such as code and design, but cannot give definitive answers about the assignment requirements—please direct those questions to Ryan.

### Late Work

All projects and exercises must be submitted at the beginning of the class on the date specified in the assignment brief unless otherwise stated by your professor. An assignment submitted within one week (5 business days) after the due date, will receive a 10% grade reduction. Assignments more than one week late will not be graded unless a prior arrangement has been made with your professor.

If there is a valid reason for the late assignment, the student must email their professor as soon as possible, and no later than the date the assignment is due to indicate it will be late. If the reason is deemed to be valid, there will be no late penalty.

There will be no resubmission of work unless:    
A) under exceptional circumstances, this has been agreed to or suggested by the professor.    
B) you hand work in **on time** and the work is of a **failing grade**, you will be given the opportunity to resubmit the work within one week of receiving the grade from your professor.

Academic accommodations must be discussed in advance of the due date in order to work out a plan that ensures your success—simply providing extra time for an assignment can often prove detrimental to your learning in the course.

Missing a deadline is stressful. Sometimes it is the result of bad timing and dumb luck, other times it is something more persistent—struggling to understand material, personal life getting in the way of academics, your current mental state, or a combination of all these things. If you are feeling stuck and need help, I am here—that's my job—to help you succeed.

If you think you can’t make a deadline, please let me know as soon as possible. Together, we can work on a plan to get you back on track to ensure your success in this course.

**PLEASE NOTE** — Computer hardware/software failure does not constitute a valid reason for a late assignment, please make regular back-ups of your work to ensure timely delivery of your project. Extra storage on Dropbox is available using this link.

### Academic Honesty

The principle of academic honesty requires that all work submitted for evaluation and course credit be the original, unassisted work of the student. Cheating or plagiarism including borrowing, copying, purchasing or collaborating on work, except for group projects arranged and approved by the faculty member, or otherwise submitting work that is not the student’s own violates this principle and will not be tolerated. Instances of academic dishonesty, including assisting another student to cheat, will be penalized as detailed in the Student Handbook.

Students who have any questions regarding whether or not specific circumstances involve a breach of academic honesty are advised to discuss them with the faculty member prior to submitting the assignment in question.
