## Communication

### Email

You can email me at [ryan.price1@sheridancollege.ca](mailto:ryan.price1@sheridancollege.ca).

I will reply within 24 hours. If you do not get a response within this time, please assume that your email was not delivered and send it again.

Emailing me the night before an assignment deadline is not a good idea, so stay on top of work to make sure you succeed.

### Teams
MS Teams is the main form of communication for the class. I will post information to our class Team and may message you directly via the Chat.

Most questions can be quickly asked through Teams. I am also more likely to have a faster response time on Teams. Same rule applies: If you do not get a response within 24 hours, please assume that your message was not delivered and try again.

In general, communications will take place during "busioness hours". That means, evening and weekends I am not as likely to reply until the next "business day".

## Grading

All assignments are due at the _end of class_ on the date assigned unless noted otherwise.

Assignments are on Slate with detailed  outlines, due dates, grade weights, and rubrics. If you have any questions about the assignment, please get in touch before the due date. 

Your PAL can help you with code and design, but can't help with the assignment requirements. Please direct assignment questions to Ryan.

### Late Work

All assignments are due at the _end of class_ on the date assigned unless noted otherwise.

 An assignment submitted one week after the due date, will receive a 10% grade reduction. Assignments submitted after that will receive a zero unless approved by Ryan.

If there is good reason for a late assignment, you must email Ryan as soon as possible. If the reason for being late is acceptable, there will be no late penalty.

There will be no resubmission of work unless:    
A) under extreme circumstances, this has is suggested by the professor.    
B) you hand your work in **on time** and  **complete** and got a failing grade. You can resubmit the work within one week of receiving the grade from your professor.

Academic accommodations must be arranged before the due date. We need to work out a plan that ensures your success— providing extra time for an assignment can often cause more problems than solutions.

Missing a deadline is stressful. Sometimes it is because of bad timing and dumb luck. Sometimes it is because you are struggling to understand the class, your personal life is getting in the way, your mental health is suffering, or a combination of all these things. If you are feeling stuck and need help, I am here—that's my job—to help you succeed.

If you think you can’t make a deadline, please let me know as soon as possible. Together, we can work on a plan to get you back on track to ensure your success in this course.

**PLEASE NOTE** — Computer hardware/software failure is not a valid reason for a late assignment. Please make regular back-ups of your work to ensure timely delivery of your project. 

### Academic Honesty

All your work must be original and created by you. Cheating or plagiarism are not acceptable.  This includes borrowing, copying (without citation), purchasing, or collaborating on work. Submitting work that is not your own violates the school's academic honesty policy. 

The penalty for academic dishonesty can be severe. You can fail the assignment, the class, or be expelled.
